# Technical Assignment Brief

## Overview
This technical assignment involves working with a GraphQL API deployed on AWS CDK Lambda functions. The API provides functionality for user registration and task management, backed by a PostgreSQL database and utilizing TypeORM for database interactions. The API is hosted at https://p3xyeb9kt4.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/prod.

## What is required in this API?
- Fetch Tasks and Users
- Register Users
- Create a task
- Update a Task
- Delete a Task
- Find Task by Status

## Technologies Used
AWS CDK Lambda Functions: The backend is deployed on AWS CDK Lambda functions, offering scalable serverless infrastructure.

PostgreSQL Database: The API uses a PostgreSQL database to persist user and task information.

TypeORM: TypeORM is employed for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, providing a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution.

## Queries and Mutations
- All Queries and mutations can be found in the [Front End API Documentation and Guide](./FrontendDocumentation.md)

## Getting Started
- Use your preferred HTTP client tool (e.g., Postman, Insomnia) or integrate the queries and mutations directly into your front-end application.
- Send POST requests to the GraphQL API endpoint https://p3xyeb9kt4.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/prod.


Happy coding!
